**What it is:** The [EU AI Act](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence) is groundbreaking legislation that establishes comprehensive rules for AI systems based on their potential risks. It represents one of the world's first major regulatory frameworks specifically designed for artificial intelligence.

**Relevance to AI:**

- Creates legal obligations for AI system providers and users within the European Union
- Establishes different requirements based on the risk level of AI applications
- Requires transparency, risk assessment, and documentation throughout the AI lifecycle
- Affects any organization that develops, imports, or uses AI systems in the EU market

**Risk categories under the EU AI Act:**

- **Prohibited AI:** Systems that pose unacceptable risks (e.g., social scoring systems)
- **High-risk AI:** Systems with significant potential for harm (e.g., AI in healthcare, education, or law enforcement)
- **Limited-risk AI:** Systems requiring transparency obligations (e.g., chatbots, deepfakes)
- **Minimal-risk AI:** Systems with few or no obligations

#### GDPR: General Data Protection Regulation

**What it is:** The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data privacy law that governs how personal data is collected, processed, stored, and transferred within the European Union and European Economic Area.

**Relevance to AI:**

- AI systems often rely on personal data for training and operation
- Affects data collection practices, consent mechanisms, and data subject rights
- Requires explanations of automated decision-making processes (AI explainability)
- Impacts data retention, anonymization, and cross-border data transfers

**Key GDPR principles affecting AI:**

- **Lawful basis:** Organizations must have a legal justification for processing personal data
- **Data minimization:** Only collect and process data that is necessary for the specified purpose
- **Transparency:** Individuals must be informed about how their data is used
- **Right to explanation:** Individuals have the right to understand automated decision-making
- **Data portability:** Individuals can request their data in a machine-readable format
